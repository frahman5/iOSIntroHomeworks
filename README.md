# iOSIntroHomeworks
This repo holds a small collection of homeworks I did for an introductory iOS course at Cornell Tech

## Homework1
In this homework, I made a one page app that learns portmanteaus. It displays mastery of the following concepts:
   - creating a view
   - Inputting text and holding it in a variable
   - Storing and retrieving data in NSDictionary
   - String Manipulation
  
## Homework2
In this homework, I made a multi page to do list app. It allows you to add to-do items to two different todo lists: to buy, and and todo. 
This app displays mastery of the following concepts:
  - Creating a view
  - Inputting text, holding it in a variable, and storing and retrieving it via NSDictionary
  - Creation and display of a tableview
  - Ability to create and manage UIButtons.
